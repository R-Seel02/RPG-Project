# SER225 RPG Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class.
Students were paired up in teams for an entire semester, and utilized agile development to work further on this game.

## Yeah, but what is the game?
This is The Legend of Thimineur. It's a 2D top-down RPG game where you play as an adventurer trying to take down the evil King John Kingsley. <br>
You don't remember much. All you know is you woke up outside your house, all bruised up, and that Kingsley kicked your butt. He needs to go, and you'll be the one to do it - once you're powerful enough to beat him!

## How to run this project?
We did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
We recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or VSCode to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
